===========
 Amazon S3
===========

Use s3cmd for command-line access to S3 and easy backup/restore:

  http://s3tools.org/s3cmd
  http://populationjim.com/2011/02/21/install-and-setup-s3cmd-on-a-mac/

s3cmd stores its configuration in this file:

  ~/.s3cfg

To backup an S3 bucket via s3cmd:

  mkdir ~/Desktop/bucket-name
  s3cmd sync --recursive s3://bucket-name ~/Desktop/bucket-name

To restore an S3 bucket via s3cmd (the -P option sets public read-only permissions,
without it, the general public will see an "Access Denied" error):

  s3cmd put -P --recursive ~/Desktop/bucket-name s3://bucket-name


========
 Apache
========

Files are located here:

  /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
  /private/var/log/apache2/error_log

To start/stop/restart Apache:

  sudo apachectl start|stop|restart




=====
 APC
=====

To install APC on OSX 10.7:

  * Follow these instructions: http://neilang.com/entries/install-apc-on-osx/ 
  * When done, add apc.enable_cli=1 to php.ini.




=====
 Bash
=====

To execute a command once for every file in the current directory:
(From: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10523415/bash-script-to-execute-command-on-all-files-in-directory)

  for file in ./*; do cmdname $file; done

To recursively (-r) zip a folder (and all of its contents), split the resulting archive into multiple 1 GB files (-s 1g),
and do it all as fast as possible (-0 switch means no compression; -9 would be max compression):

  zip -r -s 1g -0 archivename.zip foldername/

To find a file (where . is the starting directory, use / for entire system):

  find . -name "file.txt"

If a directory contains too many files, "ls" or "rm" can take a long time. You can use "find" to delete files faster.

  find . -name "file.txt" -delete




=====
 Git
=====

To show changed files and their status:

  git status -s

To un-stage a single file from the index:

  git reset <filename>

To reset changes made to an un-staged file:

  git checkout <filename>

To blow away all current changes and reset to the last commit:

  git reset --hard

To remove newly created (but not yet added to the repo) files:

  git clean -f

To merge a branch into another branch:

  git checkout destinationBranchName
  git merge sourceBranchName

To find the common ancestor between two branches, use git merge-base:

  git merge-base branchname1 branchname2

To get the names of all files changed between two commits:

  git diff --name-only commit1SHAorBranchName commit2SHAorBranchName

To get the names of all files changed from the creation of the current branch to its head:

  git diff --name-only `git merge-base head master` head

To search the Git commit history for a commit message containing a particular string:

  git log --grep="your search term"

To revert the effects of a given commit without auto-committing the result (so you can inspect and edit the reverted changes):

  git revert -n <commit hash whose changes should be reverted>

To create a copy of the current HEAD commit without .git folders and other metadata (similar to svn export):

  git archive -o output.zip HEAD

To cherry pick from another repository

  1. Add a remote for that repository:
      cd tabletfe
      git remote add mobilefe ssh://ssh@github.com/SMG-Digital/mobilefe.git

  2. Fetch from the new remote:
      git fetch mobilefe

  3. Now cherry pick the commits you want from the remote (just use their SHA values):
      git cherry-pick -x e8f95894b77b602655ee635f9be559ce9802884e

  4. Resolve any conflicts if necessary.

 Heroku
=====

Deploying to Heroku was difficult the first time. Here is how I did it (after installing Heroku Toolchain):

  heroku login (only need to run this the first time)
  cd your_rails_projects_git_repo
  heroku create
  git push heroku master
  heroku pg:reset
  heroku run rake db:schema:load
  heroku open

To migrate your database on Heroku:

  heroku run rake db:migrate --app appname

To deploy a branch to your Heroku staging server:

  git push staging your-branch-name:master

To import a Heroku production backup into your Heroku staging server:

  heroku pgbackups:restore DATABASE_COLOR `heroku pgbackups:url backup_id --app production-app-name` --app staging-app-name

To take your website offline for maintenance, then online when you're done:

  heroku maintenance:on
  heroku maintenance:off

To check Heroku Postgres database size, use:

  heroku pg:info

To open a Heroku Postgres console, use:

  heroku pg:psql

To view all Heroku Postgres backups:

  heroku pgbackups

To backup your main Heroku Postgres database:

  heroku pgbackups:capture

To create a publically-accessible URL to a Postgres database backup (expires in 10 minutes):

  heroku pgbackups:url backup_id

To destroy a Heroku Postgres backup:

  heroku pgbackups:destroy backup_id

To restore to your Postgres primary database from a backup:

  heroku pgbackups:restore DATABASE backup_id

 MySQL
=======

Files are located here:

  /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql
  sudo /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld --verbose --help
  /etc/my.cnf 

SQL can be kind of a pain to log in to. If the host, user, password and database are not exactly correct, the error message is cryptic.
Be very explicit to ward off problems:

  mysql -h host_name -u user_nae -p -D database_name

To dump a MySQL database:

  mysqldump -u username -p dbname > output.sql

To import a MySQL database dumped via mysqldump:

  mysql -u username -p dbname < output.sql

 PostgreSQL
=========

To install PostgreSQL on Mac OS:

  http://railscasts.com/episodes/342-migrating-to-postgresql

To create a PostgreSQL database:

  createdb database_name

After PostgreSQL has been installed for the first time, you will be unable to use the
psql command to access its command line terminal. An error will appear saying 'database
"yourusername" does not exist'. You will need to create a database with a name matching
your username in order to proceed:

  createdb yourusername

To enter the PostgreSQL command line and work on a specific database use:

  psql -d database_name

To exit the psql command line utility:

  \q

To set up a PostgreSQL database for app_name with user app_name for a Rails project:

  createdb app_name
  psql -d app_name
  CREATE USER app_name LOGIN CREATEDB;
  ALTER USER app_name WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'password'; # note, it appears that you must use single quotes here
  \q

To list all tables within the psql command line utility:

  \d





=========
 Rails 3
=========

To create a new rails project:

  mkdir project_dir
  cd project_dir
  rails new .

To show all RVM gemsets:

  rvm gemset create name_of_gemset

To scaffold an entire RESTful resource (including model, controller, view, and tests):

  rails generate scaffold ModelName some_db_column:type another_db_column:type

To scaffold *just* a controller:

  rails generate controller ControllerName action_name another_action_name

Rails scaffolding field types:

  string
  text (long text, up to 64k, often used for text areas)
  datetime
  date
  integer
  binary
  boolean
  float
  decimal (for financial data)
  time
  timestamp

To update development database with schema changes:

  bundle exec rake db:migrate

To generate a blank database migration:

  rails generate migration name_of_migration

To rollback database changes on exit from rails console:

  rails console --sandbox

To wipe the database and load the latest schema:

  rake db:reset
  (You might have to restart the server after running this for the changes to take effect.)

To access your local rails development server from a local virtual machine:

  rails server -b 10.211.55.2 (where the IP is the IP of your physical machine on the VM's virtual network)
  In your VM's browser, surf to: http://10.211.55.2:3000/
