" Set the all-important <Leader> key

" Pressing <Leader>. will clear the current search highlighting.
noremap <Leader>. :set hlsearch!<CR><Esc>

" Make it easy to escape from insert mode.
inoremap jk <Esc>

" Also make it easy to escape from command-line mode.
" <C-c> must be used in place of <Esc> for this mapping because Vim treats
" <Esc> in command-line mode as if it were <CR>
" As per: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Avoid_the_escape_key
cnoremap jk <C-c>
